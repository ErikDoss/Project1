    <h1>Who is Erik Doss-Carter?</h1>
    <p>If I had to describe myself and my life thus far I would use one word.</p>
    <h3>MULTIFACETED</h3>
    <p>I am many things. First and foremost, a father and husband to my wife and 2 daughters.</p>
    <p>A Soldier, and a student.</p>
    <p>A student not just in this class at this University but a student of life</p>
    <h3>Father and Husband</h3>
    <p>Here's a picture of my Wedding Complete with my daughters, little brothers, and Mother in-law</p>

    <h3>Soldier</h3>
    <p>My second proudest accomplishemnt is my days of serving as a Combat Medic</p>
    <p> I could talk for hours about my experiences in that life but i will let this quick video summarize it for me</p>

    <h3>Student</h3>
    <p>Those who know me, know that I am a person who constantly seeks out challenges.</p>
    <p>Some would call that a trouble maker but i like to refer to it as passion and desire</p>
    <p>A passion and desire to seek knowledge and aquire skills to be used throughout life.</p>
    <p>This passion has led down many avenues paved with both formal and informal education.</p>
    <p>I am a lifelong student who is constantly seeking knowledge for the betterment and advancement of my family.</p>
