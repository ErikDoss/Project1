    <h1>My Top 3 Jobs</h1>
    <p>I will list my top 3 choices for furture career paths as they relate to my current field of study</p>
    <h3>IT Consultant</h3>
    <p>I understand that I will likely have to take on other roles before being able to consult.</p>
    <p>However, this is my ideal role at this juncture</p>
    <p>I have some experience as a recruiting consultant towards the end of military career so I am familiar with the role.</p>
    <p>I thouroughly enjoyed my time consulting and would like to marry that experience with my desire to work in Information Technology.</p>
    <p>Below are a few videos on my prefered Jobs:</p>
